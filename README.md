# Todo Tasks Application

This repository contains the source code for a complete task management application (Todo Tasks), distributed in three parts: a console application, a Web API, and a frontend developed with Angular.

## Distribution

1.  **Console Application (.NET):**
    * A functional application developed in .NET, accessible and operable directly from the command line.
    * Offers an intuitive user interface to interact with tasks.

2.  **WebApi Application (.NET):**
    * A RESTful API developed in .NET that serves as the backend for task management.
    * Provides endpoints to perform the following operations:
        * Create new tasks.
        * Edit existing tasks.
        * Delete tasks.
        * Add and manage the progression of each task.

3.  **Frontend with Angular 19:**
    * A modern and reactive user interface developed with Angular 19.
    * Designed to be intuitive, attractive, and easy to use.
    * Implements the following best practices and Angular features:
        * **Signals:** For efficient and granular state management.
        * **Routers:** For smooth navigation between different sections of the application.
        * **Observables (RxJS):** For handling asynchronous data streams, especially in communication with the Web API.
        * **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier):** For a modular and maintainable CSS structure.
        * **Dependency Injection:** For a decoupled and easily testable code architecture.
        * Other Angular development best practices.

## Testing and Code Coverage

Unit and integration tests have been implemented in both the WebApi (.NET) application and the frontend (Angular). No automated tests were performed on the console application.

### Frontend (Angular) Code Coverage:

The code coverage report for the Angular frontend is as follows:
```
Statements    : 85.33% ( 64/75 )
Branches      : 50% ( 1/2 )
Functions     : 75.75% ( 25/33 )
Lines         : 84.72% ( 61/72 )
```
This indicates a good level of test coverage in Angular, yet, could be better.
